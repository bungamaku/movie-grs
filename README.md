## Development

1. Install [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
2. Install the following extensions:
   1. [TSLint for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-typescript-tslint-plugin) for highlighting TSLint errors. Also to fix it automatically (when applicable). The config to auto fix (on save action) has been included on `.vscode/settings.json`.
   2. [Prettier - Code formatter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode). Analogous to TSLint extension above but it's for Prettier.
   3. [psioniq File Header](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=psioniq.psi-header) (for header comment file). vscode command to insert header comment: `Header Insert` (on Mac keyboard: Cmd+P, then type `> Header Insert` (notice the angle bracket)). Template and instruction on how to insert it is in the bottom of this readme.
3. Run `./scripts/setup.sh`
   1. One of the goal for this script is to install node (using [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)).
   2. Sometimes we still can't execute `node` command on terminal after running the script. When this happens, please try to install it yourself. Instructions [here](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).
   3. Make sure you can execute `node` and `npm` on your terminal before proceeding.
4. Run `npm start`. For subsequent development, just run this step. No need to do step 1-3 again.
5. Navigate to `localhost:3000`

## Deployment

This is a CSR-only, single page web application.

1. To build, run `npm run build`
2. TODO: continue

## User Setting for Psioniq File Header

1. Open `vscode user setting`. On Mac: Preference > Settings and then click the curly bracket icon on top right corner to open `settings.json` file so you can edit it directly. The template is not included in `.vscode/settings.json` because it will contain developer's name and email. So it will be different on different machine.
2. Add the following entries (don't forget to update it accordingly using your name and email):

```
"psi-header.variables": [
    [
      "author",
      "<your full name>"
    ],
    [
      "authoremail",
      "<your name>@<your domain>"
    ],
    [
      "modifyauthor",
      "<your full name>"
    ],
    [
      "modifyauthoremail",
      "<your name>@<your domain>"
    ]
  ],
  "psi-header.templates": [
    {
      "language": "*",
      "template": [
        "<<filename>>",
        "DEFAULT DESCRIPTION. EDIT OR DELETE THIS.",
        "",
        "Author: <<author>> (<<authoremail>>)",
        "Created at: <<filecreated('MMMM Do YYYY')>>",
        "-----",
        "Last Modified: <<dateformat('MMMM Do YYYY')>>",
        "Modified By: <<modifyauthor>> (<<modifyauthoremail>>)",
        "-----",
        "Copyright (c) <<year>> GLAIR. All rights reserved.",
      ]
    }
  ],
  "psi-header.changes-tracking": {
    "isActive": true,
    "modAuthor": "Modified By: ",
    "modDate": "Last Modified: "
  }
```
