## Development
1. Install [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
2. Install the following extensions:
    1. [TSLint for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-typescript-tslint-plugin) for highlighting TSLint errors. Also to fix it automatically (when applicable). vscode command to fix all fixable errors: `TSLint: Fix all auto-fixable problems`. The auto-fix-on-save in vscode is using `"tslint.autoFixOnSave": true` (it's already included in `.vscode/settings.json`). The config file is in `tslint.json` (it will also read `tsconfig.json` file).
    2. [psioniq File Header](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=psioniq.psi-header) (for header comment file). vscode command to insert header comment: `Header Insert` (on Mac keyboard: Cmd+P, then type `> Header Insert` (notice the angle bracket)). Template is in the bottom of this readme.
3. Run `./scripts/setup.sh`
4. Run `npm start`. For subsequent development, just run this step. No need to do step 1-3 again.
5. Nvaigate to `localhost:3000`
